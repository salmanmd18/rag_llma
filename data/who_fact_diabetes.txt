Title: Diabetes – WHO Fact Sheet

Content: Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose, which over time leads to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough insulin. The global prevalence of diabetes has risen dramatically in the past four decades. According to WHO, approximately 422 million people worldwide have diabetes. Effective management includes lifestyle interventions, oral medications, and insulin therapy. Preventive measures focus on maintaining healthy body weight, engaging in physical activity, and adopting a healthy diet.
