Title: Efficacy of mRNA Vaccines Against Emerging COVID-19 Variants

Abstract: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has raised concerns regarding vaccine efficacy. We performed a real-world effectiveness study on mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) during periods of Delta and Omicron variant dominance. Among 45,000 participants, vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection declined from 92% (Delta) to 71% (Omicron), but protection against severe disease remained high (89%). Booster doses restored effectiveness to 85% against symptomatic Omicron infections. These results reinforce the importance of booster vaccination strategies to maintain population-level immunity.
